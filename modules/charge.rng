    <a:documentation> A charge is something that is used by interactions to compute the forces
      acting on a body. If a body is connected with a spring or a constraint, then the body position
      becomes the charge. For an electric field, the charge is the electric charge. For a rigid body
      connected by a hinge to another, the charge is an attachment frame which specifies the axis of
      the hinge from the center of mass. For contacts, the charge includes material properties and a
      geometry which could differ from that of the visuals, or that used for computing mass
      properties. Also for contacts, one might use several geometries for the case of a contact with
      a height field, or a contact with a meshed object, etc., as well as several materials for,
      say, the top and bottom surfaces of an object. One can of course have an “anti-contact” to
      specify that a body does not collide with another one. All these attributes can be included in
      a charge of type “contact”. Therefore, a body can contain any number of different charges
      which are hooks for the interactions. Some basic charges must be assumed by default such as
      for gravity and contacts in which case default values are used. The list of possible charges
      and their attributes must be extensible though a large set can be specified in the
      schema.</a:documentation>
