  <define name="interaction">

    <a:documentation> Base class for interactions. Interactions define how the forces acting on each
      body are computed. This includes for instance uniform gravity, which is an interaction between
      the “null” body and all bodies, air friction either with a wind field or the “null” body,
      simple joints, pairwise forces, etc. This does not include kinematic controllers however. An
      interaction must contain a list of bodies it acts on and specify which charge it uses for the
      computations. It is assumed that kinematics and dynamics data is used by all interactions. The
      method for computation is left entirely to the simulation engine. A difficulty is already
      apparent here since a spring can have a variable spring constant, it can also be a power law,
      and the damping coefficient might also depend on velocities and on the extension of the
      spring. But being such a simple type of interaction, it should be possible for a given engine
      to use a simplified model. How to do this? </a:documentation>

          <a:documentation> The "pairs" attribute can be used to select body pairs in the system
            that we want to apply this interaction on. Type is XPath. If a group or transform is
            selected, all contained pairs will be selected.</a:documentation>
